# Snake Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame.

## Description

The snake game is a game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. In this implementation, the snake moves in four directions, and the objective is to eat the fruit that randomly spawns in the area. The game ends when the snake hits the game boundary or its own body.
